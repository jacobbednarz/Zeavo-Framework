### Overview
This framework is written for those who write applications and need a framework 
that is modular, PHP5 based, adheres to the MVC pattern and has a focus on 
performance. Zeavo Framework is intended to have a low learning curve and be 
packed full of features all backed up with rock solid security.

Zeavo Framework will is an open source project released under the MIT license
so it is free for you to fork and commit your own changes.  

### Why I didn't want to use "x" framework or application
The main reason this framework was developed was due to my growing work load and
need for an easy and consistent start to my projects. I found the funtionality I 
was consistently using and combined it all to become the framework that it is now.

I won't lie, there are already _alot_ of good frameworks out there but the trouble
with them is that they are too big for many of my small clients or the learning
curve is far to time consuming to bother with.

### The future
I do have some additions planned that should help expand this framework as well as 
provide a decent base for other developers to pick and pull apart for their own 
purposes. The planned additions are:

1. Database query builder/Abstraction class
2. Modules (all of which can be added or removed depending on your needs)
3. Caching
4. Decent documentation
	* Will be based off the PHP DocBlocks but just easier to access then needing to 
	read through the file for it. 

### Documentation
Check out the new docs home, in the [wiki](https://github.com/jacobbednarz/Zeavo-Framework/wiki/) of course!
